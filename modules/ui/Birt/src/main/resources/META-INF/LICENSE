IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE EXADEL SOFTWARE. CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TERMS ARE DEFINED IN SECTION 11.

1. LICENSE TERMS

(a) Evaluation Use. The terms of this Section 1(a) are applicable to you if you have registered on Exadel's website and downloaded a trial version of Exadel's software. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Exadel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to use the evaluation version of the Software solely for Evaluation Use. Third party software products or modules supplied by Exadel, if any, may be used solely with the Software. Unless a different term is noted on Exadel's website at the time of download, this license limits you to fifteen (15) days usage to a limited set of Software functionality (the "Evaluation Limitation"). All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Exadel.

(b) Development Use. The terms of this Section 1(b) are applicable to you if you have either downloaded a free version (that is not a trial version for Evaluation Use) or purchased a license of Exadel software. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Exadel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, fee-bearing license to use the Software solely for Development Use for the number of users and the number of CPU's, Servers and/or at the Sites, as specified on Exadel's invoice. Third party software products or modules supplied by Exadel, if any, may be used solely with the Software. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Exadel.

(c) Restrictions on Use. Whether the Software is being licensed for Evaluation or Development Use, you may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to determine source code or protocols from the Software or disclose the results of software performance benchmarks to any third party without Exadel's prior written consent. Additional restrictions, if any, with respect to third party software will be delivered to you along with your license key. You may not distribute, lease, rent, resell or sublicense Software (whether purchased or free) to any third party or co-worker, or otherwise use it except as permitted in this Agreement.

(d) Ownership Rights. You may modify the Software in accordance with the Documentation solely to allow for interoperability with your internal MIS system. Such modifications shall not be derivative works, nor shall you create or attempt to create any derivative works from the Software. Title, ownership rights and all intellectual property rights in and to the Software shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Exadel.

(e) Copies and Number of Users. The terms of this Section 1(e) are applicable to you if you are a Development Use customer. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software and Documentation (provided that all copyright and other proprietary notices of Exadel and its licensors are reproduced), solely for archival purposes. If you do copy for this purpose, you will preserve any proprietary rights notices on the Software and place such notices on any and all copies you made or make. If you would like to change the number of Users, or number or identity of Sites, CPU's and/or Servers indicated on your invoice, you must contact Exadel in writing for our approval; you may be subject to additional fees.

(f) Territory. The license grants hereunder are limited to use within the Territory.

(g) Exadel jsf4birt Software.  The terms and conditions of this Section 1(g) are applicable if you have downloaded Exadel jsf4birt Software consisting of certain component libraries and related development tools (collectively, "Exadel jsf4birt"), regardless of whether you have downloaded a trial version for Evaluation Use or a free or fee-based version for Development Use.  This Section 1(g) is in addition to (not in lieu of) the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of which apply to use of Exadel jsf4birt.  However, if any term or condition of this Agreement conflicts with any portion of this Section 1(g), this Section 1(g) shall govern.
 
      (i) Subject to compliance with other restrictions on your license (such as, but not limited to, the number of users), you may use Exadel jsf4birt for internal development of applications and other products for internal use. You may not repackage, sell, distribute, sublicense, or otherwise transfer Exadel jsf4birt or any of its components to, or otherwise permit the use of Exadel jsf4birt or any of its components by, any third parties; provided, however, that if Exadel jsf4birt component libraries are inherently incorporated into run-time applications for sale, distribution, or other transfer to, or use by, any third parties (collectively, "Distributed Products"), you must include with Distributed Products the Distribution License Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto and you must secure and provide to Exadel the third party's verified and documented acceptance of the Distribution License Agreement before permitting the transferee to use the Distributed Product. Possession or use of Exadel jsf4birt or any of its components by any third party who receives Exadel jsf4birt or such components from you and who has not accepted the Exadel Distribution License Agreement constitutes your breach of this Agreement.

     (ii) The only permitted Distributed Products are run-time applications that will not function properly without inherently incorporating Exadel jsf4birt component libraries or portions thereof.  Without limiting the foregoing, you may not sell, distribute, sublicense, otherwise transfer Exadel jsf4birt development environments or development tools to any third parties, or otherwise permit the use of Exadel jsf4birt development environments or development tools by any third parties.

You will pay all sales, use, VAT and other consumption taxes, personal property taxes and other taxes (other than those based on Exadel's net income) unless you furnish Exadel with written proof of exemption.
